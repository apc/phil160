    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the website for PHIL 160 at <a href="http://www.umass.edu">UMass Amherst</a>. Announcements, readings, and other relevant information will be posted here. If you are enrolled in this class, you should be checking <a href="http://perezcarballo.org/phil160">this website</a> regularly, as well as the <a href="http://perezcarballo.org/phil160/calendar">course calendar</a>.</p>

<p>For your convenience, I have set up a mailing list for this course. I encourage you to subscribe in order to be notified of announcements on this site. Note, however, that you will only be notified of updates to the site once a day. (If there are no new updates on a given day, you will receive no emails.)</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I have also set up a <a href="https://moodle.umass.edu/course/view.php?id=13334">Moodle page</a> for this website. However, we will only use that page for two purposes: you will submit your assignments there, and you will be able to review your grades for the course. If I ever need you to check the <a href="https://moodle.umass.edu/course/view.php?id=13334">Moodle page</a> I will make sure to make an announcement <a href="http://perezcarballo.org/phil160">on this page</a>.</p>

<p>(Of course, your TA may well want to use Moodle for announcements to students in his or her discussion sections. Please check with your TA about this.)</p>

<p>If you are enrolled in this class, or are thinking about enrolling, you may want to take a look at the <a href="http://perezcarballo.org/phil160/syllabus">course syllabus</a>.</p>
